# What is View
They are the tables that summarize the data by taking the data from the real tables used as virtual tables in the SQL server environment. It is a sql server object that is stored permanently, not instantly.

# Trigger
When we run a query in SQL, it is the code written to run another query. For example, when we delete, update or add a record from a table, it also updates it from another table.
